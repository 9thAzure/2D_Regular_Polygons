# 2D Regular Polygons
Adds 3 nodes for creating regular polygons, most with additional options.
1 draws a regular shape, another creates regular collision shapes.
The third also draws regular shapes, but doesn't have additional options the others do.

There are c# classes for creating/wrapping these nodes in 'RegularPolygons2D' namespace.

Nodes:
- SimplePolygon2D
- RegularPolygon2D
- RegularCollisionPolygon2D

Complex Properties:
- Width
- Drawn arc
- Corner size/Corner smoothness
